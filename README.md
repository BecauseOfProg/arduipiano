## üåà How it works

One buzzer and many buttons are connected to an Arduino. Buttons represent piano keys so when a user press one of them, the buzzer will play a note that it defined. In the future, I hope there will be an "auto" mode, where keys are automatically associated with notes.

## ‚å® Hardware setup

To make this piano, you will need :

- An Arduino. Any model will do the job
- A passive buzzer
- Some buttons
- A lot of wires

Connect the buzzer to a specific pin, and buttons on all other free pins. Since they're in pullup mode in the code, you don't have to place resistors in order to make them work. If you feel placing a current limiting resistor, it's up to you !

## üì≤ Software setup

Register your piano's keys and the buzzer's pin in the `src/keys.h` file. Even if you don't know much about programming, you don't have to worry : all is documented in this file. If you have troubles, feel free to open an issue on the repository !

After that step, upload the main.ino sketch into the board. If you did all the steps correctly, your piano must start working !
